      <description>Housing Prices Project   Housing Prices Project Competition Description:   Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won&amp;rsquo;t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition&amp;rsquo;s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
  With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.</description>
